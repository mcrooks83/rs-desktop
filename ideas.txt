Ideas for improving this 

1. manage multiple sensors - mainly the ui components 
2. create improved displays for each sensor - view class per sensor?
3. using inheritence and abstract methods reduce the callbacks required
4. use some kind of lookup to configure the sensors - data rate mainly - add to sidebar
5. make the plot updates concurrent

There needs to be a way to handle the different payloads available and ensure all the parts align

set the payload to be "some_payload"
the encoding must be altered for that payload
the writing to csv header must be altered 
the display must be altered as the data will be in different positions in the packet

could be represented as a Payload Class
